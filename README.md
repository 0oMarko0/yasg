## YET ᗩᑎOTᕼEᖇ ᔕᑎᗩKE GᗩᗰE
This project as started during christmas time while i was off from school.
My main goal was to carry out a simple project while keeping as much as
i can a clean architecture. I just had done my architecture class
and i thought it would be a great way of appling what i have learned.

There's propablly more than enought snake game on github and on the web, so why 
chosing this ? The scale for this project was perfect for the time line i had to complete 
it. I've tried to focuse mainly on architecure. The main goal was to make this project as 
extensible as possible. I wanted the game logic completly independent from pygame so i could,
 if i want, make a web interface and a api whit [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
